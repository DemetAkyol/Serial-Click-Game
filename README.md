# Serial-Click-Game
A sample Server/Client game writen with Jama Multi Therad Programming

An interactive game has been developed in which two or more users can connect and play simultaneously.The game contains a founder and n players. 
The game is simply played by players' clicks on the objects that will appear dynamically on a pixel-based screen at the width-height.

The server sends the newly created object information to all players at the same time. By clicking on the object that appears in the specified coordinates, coordinates and time information are sent from the player application to the server application. By synchronizing the incoming time data, the server decides which player has clicked earlier and transfers the score to the corresponding user.
